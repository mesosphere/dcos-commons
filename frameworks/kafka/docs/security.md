# DC/OS Apache Kafka Security

The DC/OS Apache Kafka service supports Kafka's native transport encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms. The service provides automation and orchestration to simplify the usage of these important features.

A good overview of these features can be found [here](https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-security-authorization-authentication-encryption/), and Kafka's security documentation can be found [here](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security).

*Note*: These security features are only available on DC/OS Enterprise 1.10 and above.

## Transport Encryption

{% include services/security-transport-encryption-lead-in.md
    techName="Apache Kafka" plaintext="true" %}

*Note*: Enabling transport encryption is _required_ to use [SSL authentication](#ssl-authentication) for [authentication](#authentication), but is optional for [Kerberos authentication](#kerberos-authentication).

{% include services/security-configure-transport-encryption.md
    techName="Apache Kafka" plaintext="true" %}

*Note*: It is possible to update a running DC/OS Apache Kafka service to enable transport encryption after initial installation, but the service may be unavailable during the transition. Additionally, your Kafka clients will need to be reconfigured unless `service.security.transport_encryption.allow_plaintext` is set to true.

#### Verify Transport Encryption Enabled

After service deployment completes, check the list of [Kafka endpoints](../api-reference/#connection-information) for the endpoint `broker-tls`. If `service.security.transport_encryption.allow_plaintext` is `true`, then the `broker` endpoint will also be available.

{% include services/security-transport-encryption-clients.md %}

## Authentication

DC/OS Apache Kafka supports two authentication mechanisms, SSL and Kerberos. The two are supported independently and may not be combined. If both SSL and Kerberos authentication are enabled, the service will use Kerberos authentication.

*Note*: Kerberos authentication can, however, be combined with transport encryption.

### Kerberos Authentication

Kerberos authentication relies on a central authority to verify that Kafka clients (be it broker, consumer, or producer) are who they say they are. DC/OS Apache Kafka integrates with your existing Kerberos infrastructure to verify the identity of clients.

#### Prerequisites
- The hostname and port of a KDC reachable from your DC/OS cluster
- Sufficient access to the KDC to create Kerberos principals
- Sufficient access to the KDC to retrieve a keytab for the generated principals
- [The DC/OS Enterprise CLI](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.10/cli/enterprise-cli/#installing-the-dcos-enterprise-cli)
- DC/OS Superuser permissions

#### Configure Kerberos Authentication

#### Create principals

The DC/OS Apache Kafka service requires a Kerberos principal for each broker to be deployed. Each principal must be of the form
```
<service primary>/kafka-<broker index>-broker.<service subdomain>.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory@<service realm>
```
with:
- `service primary = service.security.kerberos.primary`
- `broker index = 0 up to brokers.count - 1`
- `service subdomain = service.name with all `/`'s removed`
- `service realm = service.security.kerberos.realm`

For example, if installing with these options:
```json
{
    "service": {
        "name": "a/good/example",
        "security": {
            "kerberos": {
                "primary": "example",
                "realm": "EXAMPLE"
            }
        }
    },
    "brokers": {
        "count": 3
    }
}
```
then the principals to create would be:
```
example/kafka-0-broker.agoodexample.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory@EXAMPLE
example/kafka-1-broker.agoodexample.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory@EXAMPLE
example/kafka-2-broker.agoodexample.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory@EXAMPLE
```
{% include services/security-kerberos-ad.md
    principal="example/kafka-0-broker.agoodexample.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory@EXAMPLE"
    spn="example/kafka-0-broker.agoodexample.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory"
    upn="example/kafka-0-broker.agoodexample.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory@EXAMPLE" %}

{% include services/security-service-keytab.md
    techName="Apache Kafka" %}

#### Install the Service

Install the DC/OS Apache Kafka service with the following options in addition to your own:
```json
{
    "service": {
        "security": {
            "kerberos": {
                "enabled": true,
                "enabled_for_zookeeper": <true|false default false>,
                "kdc": {
                    "hostname": "<kdc host>",
                    "port": <kdc port>
                },
                "primary": "<service primary default kafka>",
                "realm": "<realm>",
                "keytab_secret": "<path to keytab secret>",
                "debug": <true|false default false>
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*Note*: If `service.kerberos.enabled_for_zookeeper` is set to true, then the additional setting `kafka.kafka_zookeeper_uri` must be configured to point at a kerberized Apache ZooKeeper as follows:
```json
{
    "kafka": {
        "kafka_zookeeper_uri": <list of zookeeper hosts>
    }
}
```
The DC/OS Apache ZooKeeper service (`kafka-zookeeper` package) is intended for this purpose and supports Kerberos.

*Note*: It is possible to enable Kerberos after initial installation but the service may be unavailable during the transition. Additionally, your Kafka clients will need to be reconfigured.


### SSL Authentication

SSL authentication requires that all clients be they brokers, producers, or consumers present a valid certificate from which their identity can be derived. DC/OS Apache Kafka uses the `CN` of the SSL certificate as the principal for a given client. For example, from the certificate `CN=bob@example.com,OU=,O=Example,L=London,ST=London,C=GB` the principal `bob@example.com` will be extracted.

#### Prerequisites
- Completion of the section [Transport Encryption](#transport-encryption) above

#### Install the Service

Install the DC/OS Apache Kafka service with the following options in addition to your own:
```json
{
    "service": {
        "service_account": "<service-account>",
        "service_account_secret": "<secret path>",
        "security": {
            "transport_encryption": {
                "enabled": true
            },
            "ssl_authentication": {
                "enabled": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*Note*: It is possible to enable SSL authentication after initial installation, but the service may be unavailable during the transition. Additionally, your Kafka clients will need to be reconfigured.

#### Authenticating a Client

To authenticate a client against DC/OS Apache Kafka, you will need to configure it to use a certificate signed by the DC/OS CA. After generating a [certificate signing request](https://www.ssl.com/how-to/manually-generate-a-certificate-signing-request-csr-using-openssl/), you can issue it to the DC/OS CA by calling the API `<dcos-cluster>/ca/api/v2/sign`. Using `curl` the request would look like:
```bash
$ curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" \
    <dcos-cluster>/ca/api/v2/sign \
    -d '{"certificate_request": "<json-encoded-value-of-request.csr>"}'
```

The response will contain a signed public certificate. Full details on the DC/OS CA API can be found [here](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/security/ent/tls-ssl/ca-api/).

## Authorization

The DC/OS Apache Kafka service supports Kafka's [ACL-based](https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/authorization.html#using-acls) authorization system. To use Kafka's ACLs, either SSL or Kerberos authentication must be enabled as detailed above.

### Enable Authorization

#### Prerequisites
- Completion of either [SSL](#ssl-authentication) or [Kerberos](#kerberos-authentication) authentication above.

#### Install the Service

Install the DC/OS Apache Kafka service with the following options in addition to your own (remember, either SSL authentication or Kerberos _must_ be enabled):
```json
{
    "service": {
        "security": {
            "authorization": {
                "enabled": true,
                "super_users": "<list of super users>",
                "allow_everyone_if_no_acl_found": <true|false default false>
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`service.security.authorization.super_users` should be set to a semi-colon delimited list of principals to treat as super users (all permissions). The format of the list is `User:<user1>;User:<user2>;...`. Using Kerberos authentication, the "user" value is the Kerberos primary, and for SSL authentication the "user" value is the `CN` of the certificate. The Kafka brokers themselves are automatically designated as super users.

<!-- TODO. @Evan, did you write something for this already? Or am I mis-remembering? -->
*Note*:  It is possible to enable Authorization after initial installation, but the service may be unavailable during the transition. Additionally, Kafka clients may fail to function if they do not have the correct ACLs assigned to their principals. During the transition `service.security.authorization.allow_everyone_if_no_acl_found` can be set to `true` to prevent clients from being failing until their ACLs can be set correctly. After the transition, `service.security.authorization.allow_everyone_if_no_acl_found` should be reversed to `false`
