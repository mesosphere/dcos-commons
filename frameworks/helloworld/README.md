Refer to the [top-level tutorial document](../../docs/tutorial.md).

Four sample configuration files are given here (change the name of the input yml file at "universe/marathon.json.mustache"):

 - `svc.yml` (only one pod)
 - `svc_simple.yml` (two pods, with disk)
 - `svc_plan.yml` (two pods, with healthcheck, with disk, with port, and with a plan structure)
 - `svc_uri.yml` (sample pod and task specific uri's that are downloaded before task launch) 

# Framework API Port

Please note that Marathon dynamically selects a port number, and passes this information to the framework (`PORT0` in our examples). We start the API service on that given port number. You can start the framework by giving a specific port number, if you are sure that the port is available to you. This is very unlikely, so api-port should be set to a variable as shown below:  
```
    api-port : {{PORT0}}
```
