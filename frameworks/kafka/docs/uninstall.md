Run the following command from the DC/OS CLI to uninstall Kafka. Alternatively, you can uninstall Kafka from the DC/OS web interface. [More information about uninstalling DC/OS services](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.9/usage/managing-services/uninstall/).

Replace `name` with the name of the kafka instance to be uninstalled.

    $ dcos package uninstall --app-id=<name> kafka
    
Then, use the [framework cleaner script](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.9/usage/managing-services/uninstall#framework-cleaner) to remove your Kafka instance from Zookeeper and to destroy all data associated with it. The script require several arguments, the values for which are derived from your service name:

*   `framework-role` is `<name>-role`.
*   `framework-principal` is `<name>-principal`.
*   `zk_path` is `dcos-service-<name>`.
