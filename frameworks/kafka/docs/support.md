## Package Versioning Scheme

- Kafka: latest stable at the time of the release, refer to the package version.
- DC/OS: 1.9 or higher.

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of Kafka. For example, `1.5.0-3.2.1` indicates version `1.5.0` of the DC/OS integration and version `3.2.1` of Kafka.
