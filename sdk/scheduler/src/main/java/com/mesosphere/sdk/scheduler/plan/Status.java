/**
 * Status of an {@link Element}.  The Status indicates to {@link PlanManager}s how to handle {@link Plan} elements.  For
 * a {@link Step} the normal progression of states is:
 *     PENDING --> PREPARED --> STARTING --> COMPLETE
 * When something goes wrong, and a retry is desirable returning to PENDING from PREPARED or STARTING indicates that an
 * {@link Element} should be restarted.  COMPLETE is a terminal state which should not be changed, once it is reached
 * for any given processing of an {@link Element}.
 *
 * The ERROR state indicates that the initial construction of the {@link Element} failed.  This normally occurs when
 * an invalidation configuration is attempted.  For example, changing the disk size specification in a TaskSpec is
 * generally not a legal operation so attempting to create a {@link Step} {@link Element} to accomplish this work would
 * result in a {@link Step} with an ERROR state.
 *
 * The WAITING state indicates that some outside entity as interacted with an {@link Element} and indicated that
 * operation should be halted.  This is normally peformed by interrupting the
 * {@link com.mesosphere.sdk.scheduler.plan.strategy.Strategy} associated with an {@link Element}.  Clearing that
 * interruption should return the {@link Element} to an appropriate state, most likely the PENDING state.
