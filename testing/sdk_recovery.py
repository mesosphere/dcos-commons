    Perform a replace (permanent recovery) operation on the specified pod.

    The specified pod AND any additional pods in `pods_with_updated_tasks` are

    result in ONLY the kafa-0-broker task being restarted. In this case,
    pods_with_updated_tasks is specified as None.

    a rolling restart of other nodes is triggered, and
