Discuss contributions to DC/OS SDK using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/issues) and make contributions with GitHub [pull requests](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/pulls).

### Proposing Features
If you would like to propose a new feature or a significant change, first open an issue to discuss it.  Project shepherds will provide feedback on the proposed change in terms of feasibility, design, and implementation guidance.  While all proposals are welcome, those that conflict with our roadmap or design principles may not be accepted.

### Creating Pull Requests
Create pull requests against the [`master`](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/tree/master) branch. Be sure to include unit tests and integration tests, as well as updates to the documentation, default scheduler, and reference framework if necessary.

Simple pull requests (e.g., to fix documentation or comments) are welcome without an issue, but any substantial changes require an issue and discussion ahead of time.

### Merge Approvals
Pull requests are reviewed and tested prior to merging.  Often shepherds will ask contributors to make changes based on our style guidelines, design principles, or project goals.  An initial response is typically provided in less than one week.

### Communication
Most communication is done primarily over Slack. Join us via http://chat.dcos.io in the __#data-services__ and __#data-services-dev__ channels, for users and developers respectively.

To build a healthy, respectful community, we follow [Githubâ€™s community guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#building-a-strong-community).

### Licensing
