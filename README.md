=========
[DC/OS](https://dcos.io) is a datacenter operating system for running distributed services, such as databases. Like most operating systems, DC/OS has a package manager and package repository, so services can be installed with 1-click.

The __DC/OS SDK__ is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation for packaging services for DC/OS. With the SDK, you can easily integrate stateful services developed in any programing language.
 
### Benefits

* __Simple and Flexible__: The SDK provides the simplicity of a declarative YAML API as well as the flexibility to use the full Java programming language. 

* __Automate Maintenance__: Some services, such as databases, need to be maintained. With the SDK, you can automate maintenance routines to simplify operations.

* __Available and Durable__: When infrastructure fails, you need to recover without data loss or performance impact. With the SDK, you define custom detection, safety, and performance semantics so your services heal themselves.

* __Production-Proven__: Building reliable distributed services is hard. Some of the most demanding web services in the world, like Uber, use services built with the SDK for their mission-critical databases and messaging systems.

### Quick Start

From a workstation with 8G Memory, [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), run:

1. Download the DC/OS SDK.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons.git
  ```
  
2. Create your local development environment.
  ```
  cd dcos-commons/ && ./build-dcos-docker.sh
  ```
  * Visit the DC/OS cluster [dashboard](http://172.17.0.2/) to verify your development environment is running.

3. Enter your development environment.
  ```
  cd dcos-docker/ && vagrant ssh
  ```
  
4. Build your hello-world example project.
  ```
  cd /dcos-commons/frameworks/helloworld/ && ./build.sh local
  ```
  
5. Start your hello-world DC/OS service.
  ```
  dcos package install hello-world
  ```
  
6. Explore your hello-world service.
  * Visit the [dashboard](http://172.17.0.2/#/services/%2Fhello-world/) to see your hello-world service running.
  * Click through to one of your tasks (e.g. `world-server-1-<uuid>`), select the __Files__ tab, select __world-container-path__, and finally select the __output__ file.
