# Overview
We support upgrade/rollback between adjacent versions only. Concretely, to upgrade from version 2 to version 4, you must upgrade from 2 -> 3, then from 3 ->4.

# Upgrade Instructions

1. In the DC/OS web interface, destroy the Elastic instance to be updated. (This will not kill Elasticsearch node tasks).
2. Verify that you no longer see the Elastic instance in the DC/OS web interface.
3. From the DC/OS CLI, install the N+1 version of Elastic (where N is your current version) with any customizations you require in a JSON options file:

```bash
$ dcos package install elastic --options=/path/to/options.json
```

The command above will trigger the install of the new Elastic version. You can follow the upgrade progress by making a REST request identical to the one used to follow the progress of a configuration upgrade. See the Configuring section for more information.

Note: The upgrade process will cause all of your Elastic node processes to restart.
