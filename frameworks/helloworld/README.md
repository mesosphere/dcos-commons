# Sample configuration files

The default example [svc.yml](src/main/dist/svc.yml) has two pods, with volumes and is used in the 'official' `helloworld` package.

[Multiple example configuration files](src/main/dist/examples/) are also provided (change the name of the default YAML file at ["universe/config.json"](universe/config.json)). In particular:

 - [simple.yml](src/main/dist/examples/simple.yml): Bare minimum example. Just one pod, with no extra features.
 - [plan.yml](src/main/dist/examples/plan.yml): Two pods, with healthcheck, volumes, ports, and with a plan structure.
 - [uri.yml](src/main/dist/examples/uri.yml): Sample pod and task-specific URIs that are downloaded before task launch.

# Framework API Port

Please note that Marathon dynamically selects a port number, and passes this information to the framework (`PORT0` in our examples). We start the API service on that given port number. You can start the framework by giving a specific port number, if you are sure that the port is available to you. This is very unlikely, so the api-port should be set to a variable as shown below:
```
    api-port : {{PORT0}}
```
