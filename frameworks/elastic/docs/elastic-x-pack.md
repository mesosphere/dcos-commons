# Elastic X-Pack

[X-Pack](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/xpack-introduction.html) is an Elastic Stack extension that bundles security, alerting, monitoring, reporting, and graph capabilities into one easy-to-install package. X-Pack is a commercial product of Elastic that requires a license. By default, X-Pack is not installed as part of the DC/OS Elastic service. However, it's easy to enable X-Pack as part of the service configuration:

You must set the update strategy to `parallel` when you toggle X-Pack in order to force a full cluster restart.
Afterwards, you can set the update strategy back to `serial` for future updates.

You can toggle this setting at any time. This gives you the option of launching an Elastic cluster without X-Pack and then later enabling it. Or, you can run a cluster with X-Pack enabled to try out the commercial features and, if at the end of the 30-day trial period you don't wish to purchase a license, you can disable it without losing access to your data.

## License Installation

When the cluster starts up for the first time with X-Pack enabled, it will automatically generate a free 
[Basic license](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) for you. 

## License Management

To update the license key for Basic/Gold/Platinum/Enterprise subscriptions, simply use the 
[License API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/6.1/installing-license.html).

## License Expiration

If you uninstall the X-Pack plugin via the service configuration or you let your license expire, remember these two important points:

1. Your data is still there.
1. All data operations (read and write) continue to work.
