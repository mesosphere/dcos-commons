## Package Versioning Scheme

- _SERVICENAME_: _WHAT VERSION OF YOUR SERVICE IS INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE?_
- DC/OS: _LIST VERSION(S) OF DC/OS THAT YOU'VE TESTED AND SUPPORT._

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of _SERVICENAME_. For example, `1.5.0-3.2.1` indicates version `1.5.0` of the DC/OS integration and version `3.2.1` of _SERVICENAME_.

<a name="version-policy"></a>
## Version Policy

The DC/OS _SERVICENAME_ Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of _SERVICENAME_. We select stable versions of the base technology in order to promote customer success. We have selected the latest stable version from _SERVICENAME_ for new releases.
