 * An {@code Operation} represents a single action taken

 * behavior of the system: it must validate that the system
 * is in a valid, expected state to perform its action; it
 * must do its best to perform its action; lastly, it must be
 * able to roll itself back.
 *
 * Each operation is given a flexible {@code OperationDriver},
 * which can save and load arbitrary binary data on behalf of
 * the operation. This is useful for internal record keeping,
 * to simplify the implementation of {@code rollback} (in case
 * your {@code Operation} has multiple steps), or to simplify
 * the implementation of {@code doAction}, so that you can pick
