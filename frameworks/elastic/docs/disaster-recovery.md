# Backup and Restore

You interact with the Elasticsearch cluster directly to perform snapshot and restore operations. Elasticsearch's built in [snapshot and restore module](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html) allows you to create snapshots of individual indices or an entire cluster into a remote repository like a shared file system, S3, or HDFS.
