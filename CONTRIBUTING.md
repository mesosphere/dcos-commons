==================
Discuss contributions to DC/OS SDK using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/issues) and make contributions with GitHub [pull requests](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/pulls).

### Proposing Features
If you would like to propose a new feature or a significant change, first open an issue to discuss it.

### Creating Pull Requests
Create pull requests against the [`master`](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/tree/master) branch. Be sure to include unit tests and updates to the documentation, default scheduler, and reference framework where necessary.

Simple pull requests (e.g., to fix documentation or comments) are welcome without an issue, but any substantial changes require an issue and discussion ahead of time.

### Merge Approvals
Pull requests are reviewed and tested aprior to merging. Often reviewers will ask contributors to make changes prior to merging.

### Communication
Communication is primarily over Slack. Join us on http://chat.dcos.io in the __#data-services-users__ and __#data-services-dev__ channels.

To build a healthy, respectful community, we follow [Githubâ€™s community guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#building-a-strong-community).

### Licensing
