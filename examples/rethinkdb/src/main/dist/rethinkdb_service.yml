# Example YAML ServiceSpec that implements RethinkDB using DC/OS SDK.
# We establish one pod that hosts the RethinkDB web UI and serves as our main entry point to the database. In the
# below example the main 'hub' pod is named 'rethinkdb' and the server nodes are named 'rethinkdbnode'. There can be
# as many 'rethinkdbnode' pods as you need (default is 3), but in this very simplistic implementation there is only one
# 'rethinkdb' pod. We also use the proxylite pod to serve the RethinkDB web UI.

# this is the URL and port that proxylite is going to expose, we will get to this through the DC/OS web UI

  # the rethinkdb pod is the main 'hub' pod in this example, it serves the web UI and acts as our contact point when
