## Package Versioning Scheme

- Kafka: 0.11.0
- DC/OS: 1.9 or higher.

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of Kafka. For example, `1.10.0-0.11.0` indicates version `1.10.0` of the DC/OS integration and version `0.11.0` of Kafka.

<a name="version-policy"></a>
## Version Policy
The DC/OS Kafka Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org),
the base technology. We select stable versions of the base technology in order to promote customer success. We have selected
the latest stable version of Apache Kafka for new releases.
