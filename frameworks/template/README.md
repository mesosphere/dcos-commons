This template README may be used as a starting point for writing a Service Guide for your DC/OS Service.

In particular, the parts in _ALL-CAPS ITALICS_ within the linked documents should be updated to reflect your service.

Many sections are left unfilled, as they depend on how your service works. For example, we leave empty sections for you to describe how users may [Backup and Restore their data](#disaster-recovery) because any persistent service should have a backup option.
