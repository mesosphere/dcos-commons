## RethinkDB on Mesosphere DC/OS

#### Software Requirements
The following needs to be installed on your workstation/local computer

1. Python 3.4 or 2.7 with wheel support
2. Golang 1.7.x+
3. Java SDK
4. DC/OS CLI
    * [Installation Instructions](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.8/usage/cli/install/)
    * if you are using a cloud-based cluster, you will also need the `awscli` (can be installed by running: `pip install awscli`)
4. Gradle

### For the impatient

#### Setup
1. Start up a DC/OS cluster using either Vagrant or a cloud provider. For this example, your cluster can be small (1-3 agent nodes is plenty).
    * [Cloud provider](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.8/administration/installing/cloud/) (recommended)
    * [Vagrant](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.8/administration/installing/local/)
2. Sign into your cluster using the web interface and the CLI
    * `dcos config set <URL_of_dcos_cluster>`
    * `dcos auth login`

#### Get the code and build
1. Clone the Mesosphere DC/OS SDK repo:
    * `git clone https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons`
2. do `cd examples/rethinkdb`
3. Check that your `S3_BUCKET` environment variable is set to something reasonable
4. build the RethinkDB service
    * `./build.sh aws`
5. When the build succeeds, there will be three lines with instructions at the bottom of `stdout` that look like this:
```bash
dcos package repo remove rethinkdb-aws
dcos package repo add --index=0 rethinkdb-aws https://<your_S3_bucket>/stub-universe-rethinkdb.zip
dcos package install --yes rethinkdb 
```
Run the commands in your terminal. **n.b.** the exact output of the second line will vary.

6. It can take around 3-5 minutes for the package to install and to stand up all of the RethinkDB servers.

#### Use RethinkDB on DC/OS
1. To get to the RethinkDB web UI point your browser at `https://<your_DCOS_cluster_URL>/service/rethinkdb/`
2. SSH to the cluster: `dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader`
3. Run the python client `docker run -it quay.io/artrand/rethinkdbpythonclient`
    * This is a basic centos7 image that has the rethinkdb python driver and ipython2.7 installed
4. Run `$ ipython` from the master node.
5. Follow the example at [rethinkdb](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/guide/python/) while keeping an eye on the web UI (if you like).
    * to connect to the databse:
```python
import rethinkdb as r
r.connect("server-lb.rethinkdb.l4lb.thisdcos.directory", 80).repl()
```
