 * into one or more {@link Block}s. This structure is a logical abstraction of a multi-phase process
 * for performing upgrades or maintenance on a service.
 * <p>
 * To give a more concrete example, imagine a database which contains both "Data" nodes and "Index"
 * nodes, and which must be upgraded by first rolling out new Data nodes followed by new Index
 * nodes. This upgrade process could be represented as a single Stage with two Phases, where Phase-0
 * is upgrading the Data nodes and Phase-1 is upgrading the Index nodes. Each Phase would then
 * contain a list of Blocks which each reference an individual Data or Index node to be upgraded.
 * If any errors occurred during the rollout, the process would pause and the Stage would contain a
 * list of one or more error messages to be shown to the user,
