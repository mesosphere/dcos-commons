# Package Versioning Scheme

- Apache Cassandra: 3.0.13
- DC/OS: 1.8 and higher

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of Apache Cassandra. For example, `1.8.0-3.0.13` indicates version `1.8.0` of the DC/OS integration and version `3.0.13` of Apache Cassandra.

# Version Policy

The DC/OS Apache Cassandra Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of Apache Cassandra. We select stable versions of the base technology in order to promote customer success. We have selected the latest stable version from Apache Cassandra for new releases.
