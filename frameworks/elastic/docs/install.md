# Default Installation

To start a basic cluster with three master nodes, two data nodes, one ingest node, one coordinator node, and one Kibana instance, run the following command on the DC/OS CLI:

```bash
dcos package install --app elastic
```

This command creates a new Elasticsearch cluster with the default name `elastic`. Two clusters cannot share the same name, so installing additional clusters beyond the default cluster requires customizing the `name` at install time for each additional instance.

# Custom Installation

You can customize the Elasticsearch cluster in a variety of ways by specifying a JSON options file. For example, here is a sample JSON options file that customizes the service name, master transport port, and plugins:

```json
{
  "service": {
    "name": "another-cluster"
  },
  "master_nodes": {
    "transport_port": 19300
  },
  "elasticsearch": {
    "plugins": "analysis-icu,analysis-kuromoji"
  }
}

```

The command below creates a cluster using a `custom.json` file:

```bash
dcos package install --app --options=custom.json elastic
```

# Multiple Elasticsearch Cluster Installation

Installing multiple Elasticsearch clusters is identical to installing Elasticsearch clusters with custom configurations as described above. The only requirement on the operator is that a unique `name` is specified for each installation.

Sample JSON options file named `custom_name.json`:

    {
        "service": {
            "name": "another-cluster"
        }
    }

The command below creates a cluster using `custom_name.json`:

```bash
dcos package install --app --options=custom_name.json elastic
```

See the Configuring section for a list of fields that can be customized via an options JSON file when the Elasticsearch cluster is created.
