Python SSE Client
=================

This is a Python client library for iterating over http Server Sent Event (SSE)
streams (also known as EventSource, after the name of the Javascript interface
inside browsers).  The SSEClient class accepts a url on init, and is then an
iterator over messages coming from the server.

Installation
------------

Use pip::

    pip install sseclient

Usage
-----

::

    from sseclient import SSEClient

    messages = SSEClient('http://mysite.com/sse_stream/')
    for msg in messages:
        do_something_useful(msg)

Each message object will have a 'data' attribute, as well as optional 'event',
'id', and 'retry' attributes.

Optional init parameters:

- last_id: If provided, this parameter will be sent to the server to tell it to
  return only messages more recent than this ID.

- retry: Number of milliseconds to wait after disconnects before attempting to
  reconnect.  The server may change this by including a 'retry' line in a
  message.  Retries are handled automatically by the SSEClient object.

You may also provide any additional keyword arguments supported by the
Requests_ library, such as a 'headers' dict and a (username, password) tuple
for 'auth'.

Development
-----------

Install the library in editable mode::

    pip install -e .

Install the test dependencies::

    pip install pytest backports.unittest_mock

Run the tests with py.test::

    (sseclient)vagrant sseclient $ py.test

There are a couple TODO items in the code for getting the implementation
completely in line with the finer points of the SSE spec.
