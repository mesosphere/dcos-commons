# Version 2.0.0-0.11.0

## Improvements
- Based on the latest stable release of the dcos-commons SDK, which provides numerous benefits:
  - Integration with DC/OS features such as virtual networking and integration with DC/OS access controls.
  - Orchestrated software and configuration update, enforcement of version upgrade paths, and ability to pause/resume updates.
  - Placement constraints for pods.
  - Uniform user experience across a variety of services.
- Graceful shutdown for brokers.
- Update to 0.11.0.0 version of Apache Kafka (including log and protocol versions).

## Breaking Changes
