<a name="quick-start"></a>
# Quick Start

1. Install DC/OS on your cluster. See [the documentation](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/administration/installing/) for instructions.
1. If you are using open source DC/OS, install DC/OS Apache Cassandra with the following command from the DC/OS CLI. If you are using Enterprise DC/OS, you may need to follow additional instructions. See the Install and Customize section for more information.
    ```
    dcos package install beta-cassandra
    ```
You can also install DC/OS Apache Cassandra from [the DC/OS web interface](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/usage/webinterface/).
1. The service will now deploy with a default configuration. You can monitor its deployment via the Services UI in the DC/OS Dashboard.
1. Connect a client to the DC/OS Apache Cassandra service.
    ```
    dcos beta-cassandra endpoints
    ["node"]
    dcos beta-cassandra endpoints node
    {
      "address": [
        "10.0.1.125:9042",
        "10.0.2.152:9042",
        "10.0.1.22:9042"
      ],
      "dns": [
        "node-1-server.cassandra.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory:9042",
        "node-0-server.cassandra.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory:9042",
        "node-2-server.cassandra.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory:9042"
      ],
      "vip": "node.cassandra.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:9042"
    }
    ```
1. Write some data to your cluster:
```
dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader
core@ip-10-0-6-153 ~ docker run -it cassandra:3.0.13 cqlsh node-0-server.cassandra.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory
> CREATE KEYSPACE space1 WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3 };
> USE space1;
> CREATE TABLE testtable1 (key varchar, value varchar, PRIMARY KEY(key));
> INSERT INTO space1.testtable1(key, value) VALUES('testkey1', 'testvalue1');
> SELECT * FROM testtable1;
```

# Installing and Customizing

The default DC/OS Apache Cassandra installation provides reasonable defaults for trying out the service, but may not be sufficient for production use. You may require different configurations depending on the context of the deployment.

## Prerequisities
 - If you are using Enterprise DC/OS, you may [need to provision a service account](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.9/security/service-auth/custom-service-auth/) before installing DC/OS Apache Cassandra. Only someone with `superuser` permission can create the service account.
 - `strict` [security mode](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.9/administration/installing/custom/configuration-parameters/#security) requires a service account.  
 - In `permissive` security mode a service account is optional.
 - `disabled` security mode does not require a service account.
 - Your cluster must have at least 3 private nodes.

## Installation from the DC/OS CLI

To start a basic test cluster, run the following command on the DC/OS CLI. Enterprise DC/OS users must follow additional instructions. [More information about installing DC/OS Apache Cassandra on Enterprise DC/OS](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.9/security/service-auth/custom-service-auth/).

```shell
dcos package install beta-cassandra
```
You can specify a custom configuration in an `options.json` file and pass it to `dcos package install` using the `--options` parameter.

```
$ dcos package install beta-cassandra --options=<options>.json
```

For more information about building the `options.json` file, see the [DC/OS documentation](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/usage/managing-services/config-universe-service/) for service configuration access.

## Installation from the DC/OS Web Interface

You can [install DC/OS Apache Cassandra from the DC/OS web interface](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.9/usage/managing-services/install/). If you install DC/OS Apache Cassandra from the web interface, you must install the DC/OS Apache Cassandra CLI subcommands separately. From the DC/OS CLI, enter:
```bash
dcos package install beta-cassandra --cli
```
Choose `ADVANCED INSTALLATION` to perform a custom installation.

<a name="service-settings"></a>
## Service Settings

<a name="service-name"></a>
### Service Name

You must configure each instance of DC/OS Apache Cassandra in a given DC/OS cluster with a different service name. You can configure the service name in the **service** section of the advanced installation section of the DC/OS web interface. The default service name (used in many examples here) is `cassandra`.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `name`: string (default: `cassandra`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: The service name cannot be changed after the cluster has started.

<a name="data-center"></a>
### Data Center

You can configure the name of the logical data center that this Cassandra cluster runs in. This sets the `dc` property in the `cassandra-rackdc.properties` file.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `data_center`: string (default: `dc1`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `CASSANDRA_LOCATION_DATA_CENTER`: `string`

<a name="rack"></a>
### Rack

You can configure the name of the rack that this Cassandra cluster runs in. This sets the `rack` property in the `cassandra-rackdc.properties` file.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `rack`: string (default: `rac1`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `CASSANDRA_LOCATION_RACK`: `string`

<a name="remote-seeds"></a>
### Remote Seeds

You can configure the remote seeds from another Cassandra cluster that this cluster should communicate with to establish cross-data-center replication. This should be a comma-separated list of node hostnames, such as `node-0-server.cassandra.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory,node-1-server.cassandra.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory`. For more information on multi-data-center configuration, see [Configuring Multi-data-center Deployments](#configuring-multi-data-center-deployments).

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `remote_seeds`: string (default: `""`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `TASKCFG_ALL_REMOTE_SEEDS`: `string`

<a name="backup-restore-strategy"></a>
### Backup/Restore Strategy

You can configure whether the creation, transfer, and restoration of backups occurs in serial or in parallel across nodes. This option must be set to either `serial` or `parallel`. Running backups and restores in parallel has the potential to saturate your network. For this reason, we recommend that you use the default configuration for backup strategy.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `backup_restore_strategy`: string (default: `"serial"`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `BACKUP_RESTORE_STRATEGY`: `string`

<a name="cassandra-settings"></a>
## Cassandra Settings

You can configure most of the settings exposed in Apache Cassandra's `cassandra.yaml` configuration file in DC/OS Apache Cassandra. For information about these settings, see the Apache Cassandra [documentation](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/configuration/cassandra_config_file.html). Settings that you can configure include:

*   `cluster_name`

<a name="node-settings"></a>
## Node Settings

Adjust the following settings to customize the amount of resources allocated to each  node. DC/OS Apache Cassandra's [system requirements](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/operating/hardware.html) must be taken into consideration when adjusting these values. Reducing these values below those requirements may result in adverse performance and/or failures while using the service.

Each of the following settings can be customized under the **node** configuration section.

<a name="node-count"></a>
### Node Count

Customize the `Node Count` setting (default 3) under the **node** configuration section. Consult the Apache Cassandra documentation for minimum node count requirements.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `count`: integer (default: `3`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `NODES`: `integer`

<a name="cpu"></a>
### CPU

You can customize the amount of CPU allocated to each node. A value of `1.0` equates to one full CPU core on a machine. Change this value by editing the **cpus** value under the **node** configuration section. Turning this too low will result in throttled tasks.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `cpus`: number (default: `0.5`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `CASSANDRA_CPUS`: `number`

<a name="memory"></a>
### Memory

You can customize the amount of RAM allocated to each node. Change this value by editing the **mem** value (in MB) under the **node** configuration section. Turning this too low will result in out of memory errors. The `heap.size` setting must also be less than this value to prevent out of memory errors resulting from the Java Virtual Machine attempting to allocate more memory than is available to the Cassandra process.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `mem`: integer (default: `10240`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `CASSANDRA_MEMORY_MB`: `integer`

<a name="jmx-port"></a>
### JMX Port

You can customize the port that Apache Cassandra listens on for JMX requests, such as those issued by `nodetool`.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `jmx_port`: integer (default: `7199`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `TASKCFG_ALL_JMX_PORT`: `integer`

<a name="storage-port"></a>
### Storage Port

You can customize the port that Apache Cassandra listens on for inter-node communication.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `storage_port`: integer (default: `7000`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `TASKCFG_ALL_CASSANDRA_STORAGE_PORT`: `integer`

<a name="ssl-storage-port"></a>
### SSL Storage Port

You can customize the port that Apache Cassandra listens on for inter-node communication over SSL.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `ssl_storage_port`: integer (default: `7001`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `TASKCFG_ALL_CASSANDRA_SSL_STORAGE_PORT`: `integer`

<a name="native-transport-port"></a>
### Native Transport Port

You can customize the port that Apache Cassandra listens on for CQL queries.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `native_transport_port`: integer (default: `9042`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `TASKCFG_ALL_CASSANDRA_NATIVE_TRANSPORT_PORT`: `integer`

<a name="rpc-port"></a>
### RPC Port

You can customize the port that Apache Cassandra listens on for Thrift RPC requests.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `rpc_port`: integer (default: `9160`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `TASKCFG_ALL_CASSANDRA_RPC_PORT`: `integer`

<a name="disk-type"></a>
### Disk Type

The service supports two volume types:
 - `ROOT` volumes are effectively an isolated directory on the root volume, sharing IO/spindles with the rest of the host system.
 - `MOUNT` volumes are a dedicated device or partition on a separate volume, with dedicated IO/spindles.

Using `MOUNT` volumes requires [additional configuration on each DC/OS agent system](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.9/storage/mount-disk-resources/), so the service currently uses `ROOT` volumes by default. To ensure reliable and consistent performance in a production environment, you should configure `MOUNT` volumes on the machines that will run the service in your cluster and then configure the following as `MOUNT` volumes:

To configure the disk type:
*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `disk_type`: string (default: `ROOT`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `CASSANDRA_DISK_TYPE`: `string`

<a name="placement-constraints"></a>
### Placement Constraints

Placement constraints allow you to customize where Apache Cassandra nodes are deployed in the DC/OS cluster. Placement constraints support all [Marathon operators](http://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/constraints.html) with this syntax: `field:OPERATOR[:parameter]`. For example, if the reference lists `[["hostname", "UNIQUE"]]`, use `hostname:UNIQUE`.

*   **In DC/OS CLI options.json**: `placement_constraint`: string (default: `""`)
*   **DC/OS web interface**: `PLACEMENT_CONSTRAINT`: `string`

<a name="uninstalling"></a>
# Uninstalling

Follow these steps to uninstall the service.

1. Uninstall the service. From the DC/OS CLI, enter `dcos package uninstall`.
1. Clean up remaining reserved resources with the framework cleaner script, `janitor.py`. [More information about the framework cleaner script](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.9/deploying-services/uninstall/#framework-cleaner).

To uninstall an instance named `cassandra` (the default), run:
```
MY_SERVICE_NAME=cassandra
dcos package uninstall --app-id=$MY_SERVICE_NAME beta-cassandra
dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader "docker run mesosphere/janitor /janitor.py \
    -r $MY_SERVICE_NAME-role \
    -p $MY_SERVICE_NAME-principal \
    -z dcos-service-$MY_SERVICE_NAME"
```

<a name="connecting-clients"></a>
# Connecting Clients

Clients communicating with Apache Cassandra use the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) to issue queries and write data to the cluster. CQL client libraries exist in many languages, and Apache Cassandra ships with a utility called `cqlsh` that enables you to issue queries against an Apache Cassandra cluster from the command line.

<a name="discovering-endpoints"></a>
## Discovering Endpoints

Once the service is running, you may view information about its endpoints via either of the following methods:
- CLI:
  - List endpoint types: `dcos beta-cassandra endpoints`
  - View endpoints for an endpoint type: `dcos beta-cassandra endpoints <endpoint>`
- Web:
  - List endpoint types: `<dcos-url>/service/cassandra/v1/endpoints`
  - View endpoints for an endpoint type: `<dcos-url>/service/cassandra/v1/endpoints/<endpoint>`

The DC/OS Apache Cassandra Service currently exposes only the `node` endpoint type, which shows the locations for all Cassandra nodes in the cluster. To see node addresses, run `dcos beta-cassandra endpoints node`. A typical response will look like the following:

```json
{
  "address": [
    "10.0.0.49:9042",
    "10.0.2.253:9042",
    "10.0.1.27:9042"
  ],
  "dns": [
    "node-2-server.cassandra.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory:9042",
    "node-0-server.cassandra.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory:9042",
    "node-1-server.cassandra.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory:9042"
  ],
  "vip": "node.cassandra.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:9042"
}
```

In general, the `.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory` endpoints will only work from within the same DC/OS cluster. From outside the cluster you can either use the direct IPs, or set up a proxy service that acts as a frontend to your DC/OS Apache Cassandra instance. For development and testing purposes, you can use [DC/OS Tunnel](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/administration/access-node/tunnel/) to access services from outside the cluster, but this option is not suitable for production use.

<a name="connecting-clients-to-endpoints"></a>
## Connecting Clients to Endpoints

To connect to a DC/OS Apache Cassandra cluster using `cqlsh`, first SSH into a host in your DC/OS cluster:
```
dcos node ssh --leader --master-proxy
```

Then, use the `cassandra` Docker image to run `cqlsh`, passing as an argument the address of one of the Apache Cassandra nodes in the cluster:
```
docker run cassandra:3.0.13 cqlsh node-0-server.cassandra.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory
```

This will open an interactive shell from which you can issue queries and write to the cluster. To ensure that the `cqlsh` client and your cluster are using the same CQL version, be sure to use the version of the `cassandra` Docker image that corresponds to the version of Apache Cassandra being run in your cluster. The version installed by the DC/OS Apache Cassandra Service is 3.0.13.

# Managing

<a name="updating-configuration"></a>
## Updating Configuration

Edit the runtime environment of the scheduler to make configuration changes. After making a change, the scheduler will be restarted, and it will automatically deploy any detected changes to the service, one node at a time. For example, a given change will first be applied to the `node-0` pod, then `node-1`, and so on.

Nodes are configured with a "Readiness check" to ensure that the underlying service appears to be in a healthy state before continuing with applying a given change to the next node in the sequence. However, this basic check is not foolproof and reasonable care should be taken to ensure that a given configuration change will not negatively affect the behavior of the service.

Some changes, such as decreasing the number of nodes or changing volume requirements, are not supported after initial deployment. See [Limitations](#limitations).

To see a full listing of available options, run `dcos package describe --config beta-cassandra` in the CLI, or browse the DC/OS Apache Cassandra Service install dialog in the DC/OS Dashboard.

<a name="adding-a-node"></a>
### Adding a Node

The service deploys 3 nodes by default. This may be customized at initial deployment or after the cluster is already running via the `NODES` environment variable. Shrinking the cluster is not supported. If you decrease this value, the scheduler will complain about the configuration change until it's reverted back to its original value or a larger one.

<a name="resizing-a-node"></a>
### Resizing a Node

The CPU and Memory requirements of each node may be increased or decreased as follows:
- CPU (1.0 = 1 core): `CASSANDRA_CPUS`
- Memory (in MB): `CASSANDRA_MEMORY_MB`. To prevent out of memory errors, you must ensure that the `TASKCFG_ALL_CASSANDRA_HEAP_SIZE` environment variable is less than `$CASSANDRA_MEMORY_MB`.

Note: volume requirements (type and/or size) can not be changed after initial deployment.

<a name="updating-placement-constraints"></a>
### Updating Placement Constraints

Placement constraints may be updated after initial deployment using the following procedure. See [Service Settings](#service-settings) above for more information on placement constraints.

Let's say we have the following deployment of our nodes

- Placement constraint of: `hostname:LIKE:10.0.10.3|10.0.10.8|10.0.10.26|10.0.10.28|10.0.10.84`
- Tasks:
```
10.0.10.3: node-0
10.0.10.8: node-1
10.0.10.26: node-2
10.0.10.28: empty
10.0.10.84: empty
```

`10.0.10.8` is being decommissioned and we should move away from it. Steps:

1. Remove the decommissioned IP and add a new IP to the placement rule whitelist by editing `PLACEMENT_CONSTRAINT`:

	```
	hostname:LIKE:10.0.10.3|10.0.10.26|10.0.10.28|10.0.10.84|10.0.10.123
	```
1. Redeploy `node-1` from the decommissioned node to somewhere within the new whitelist: `dcos beta-cassandra pods replace node-1`
1. Wait for `node-1` to be up and healthy before continuing with any other replacement operations.

<a name="restarting-a-node"></a>
## Restarting a Node

This operation will restart a node, while keeping it at its current location and with its current persistent volume data. This may be thought of as similar to restarting a system process, but it also deletes any data that is not on a persistent volume.

1. Run `dcos beta-cassandra pods restart node-<NUM>`, e.g. `node-2`.

<a name="replacing-a-node"></a>
## Replacing a Node

This operation will move a node to a new system and will discard the persistent volumes at the prior system to be rebuilt at the new system. Perform this operation if a given system is about to be offlined or has already been offlined.

**Note:** Nodes are not moved automatically. You must perform the following steps manually to move nodes to new systems. You canbuild your own automation to perform node replacement automatically according to your own preferences.

1. Run `dcos beta-cassandra pods replace node-<NUM>` to halt the current instance with id `<NUM>` (if still running) and launch a new instance elsewhere.

For example, let's say `node-2`'s host system has died and `node-2` needs to be moved.
```
dcos beta-cassandra pods replace node-2
```

<a name="configuring-multi-data-center-deployments"></a>
## Configuring Multi-data-center Deployments

To replicate data across data centers, Apache Cassandra requires that you configure each cluster with the addresses of the seed nodes from every remote cluster. Here's what starting a multi-data-center Apache Cassandra deployment would like, running inside of a single DC/OS cluster.

Launch the first cluster with the default configuration:
```
dcos package install beta-cassandra
```

Create an `options.json` file for the second cluster that specifies a different service name and data center name:
```json
{
  "service": {
    "name": "cassandra2",
    "data_center": "dc2"
  }
}
```

Launch the second cluster with these custom options:
```
dcos package install beta-cassandra --options=<options>.json
```

Get the list of seed node addresses for the first cluster from the scheduler HTTP API:
```json
DCOS_AUTH_TOKEN=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)
DCOS_URL=$(dcos config show core.dcos_url)
curl -H "authorization:token=$DCOS_AUTH_TOKEN" $DCOS_URL/service/cassandra/v1/seeds
{"seeds": ["10.0.0.1", "10.0.0.2"]}
```

In the DC/OS UI, go to the configuration dialog for the second cluster (whose service name is `cassandra2`) and update the `TASKCFG_ALL_REMOTE_SEEDS` environment variable to `10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2`. This environment variable may not already be present in a fresh install. To add it, click the plus sign at the bottom of the list of environment variables, and then fill in its name and value in the new row that appears.

Get the seed node addresses for the second cluster the same way:
```
curl -H "authorization:token=$DCOS_AUTH_TOKEN" $DCOS_URL/service/cassandra2/v1/seeds
{"seeds": ["10.0.0.3", "10.0.0.4"]}
```

In the DC/OS UI, go to the configuration dialog for the first cluster (whose service name is `cassandra`) and update the `TASKCFG_ALL_REMOTE_SEEDS` environment variable to `10.0.0.3,10.0.0.4`, again adding the variable with the plus sign if it's not already present.

Both schedulers will restart after the configuration update, and each cluster will communicate with the seed nodes from the other cluster to establish a multi-data-center topology. Repeat this process for each new cluster you add, appending a comma-separated list of that cluster's seeds to the `TASKCFG_ALL_REMOTE_SEEDS` environment variable for each existing cluster, and adding a comma-separated list of each existing cluster's seeds to the newly-added cluster's `TASKCFG_ALL_REMOTE_SEEDS` environment variable.

## Backup

### Backing Up to S3

You can backup an entire cluster's data and schema to Amazon S3 using the `backup-s3` plan. This plan requires the following parameters to run:
- `SNAPSHOT_NAME`: the name of this snapshot. Snapshots for individual nodes will be stored as S3 folders inside of a top level `snapshot` folder.
- `CASSANDRA_KEYSPACES`: the Cassandra keyspaces to backup. The entire keyspace, as well as its schema, will be backed up for each keyspace specified.
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: the access key ID for the AWS IAM user running this backup.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: the secret access key for the AWS IAM user running this backup.
- `AWS_REGION`: the region of the S3 bucket being used to store this backup.
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: the name of the S3 bucket to store this backup in.

Make sure that you provision your nodes with enough disk space to perform a backup. Apache Cassandra backups are stored on disk before being uploaded to S3, and will take up as much space as the data currently in the tables, so you'll need half of your total available space to be free to backup every keyspace at once.

As noted in the documentation for the [backup/restore strategy configuration option](#backup-restore-strategy), it is possible to run transfers to S3 either in serial or in parallel, but care must be taken not to exceed any throughput limits you may have in your cluster. Throughput depends on a variety of factors, including uplink speed, proximity to region where the backups are being uploaded and downloaded, and the performance of the underlying storage infrastructure. You should perform periodic tests in your local environment to understand what you can expect from S3.

You can configure whether snapshots are created and uploaded in serial, the default, or in parallel (see [backup/restore strategy](#backup-restore-strategy)), but the serial backup/restore strategy is recommended.

You can initiate this plan from the command line:
```
SNAPSHOT_NAME=<my_snapshot>
CASSANDRA_KEYSPACES="space1 space2"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<my_access_key_id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<my_secret_access_key>
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
S3_BUCKET_NAME=backups
dcos cassandra plan start backup-s3 -p SNAPSHOT_NAME=$SNAPSHOT_NAME -p "CASSANDRA_KEYSPACES=$CASSANDRA_KEYSPACES" -p AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -p AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -p AWS_REGION=$AWS_REGION -p S3_BUCKET_NAME=$S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

If you're backing up multiple keyspaces, they must be separated by spaces and wrapped in quotation marks when supplied to the `plan start` command, as in the example above. If the `CASSANDRA_KEYSPACES` parameter isn't supplied, then every keyspace in your cluster will be backed up.

**IMPORTANT**: To ensure that sensitive information, such as your AWS secret access key, remains secure, make sure that you've set the `core.dcos_url` configuration property in the DC/OS CLI to an HTTPS URL.

### Backing up to Azure

You can also back up to Microsoft Azure using the `backup-azure` plan. This plan requires the following parameters to run:

- `SNAPSHOT_NAME`: the name of this snapshot. Snapshots for individual nodes will be stored as gzipped tarballs with the name `node-<POD_INDEX>.tar.gz`.
- `CASSANDRA_KEYSPACES`: the Cassandra keyspaces to backup. The entire keyspace, as well as its schema, will be backed up for each keyspace specified.
- `CLIENT_ID`: the client ID for the Azure service principal running this backup.
- `TENANT_ID`: the tenant ID for the tenant that the service principal belongs to.
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: the service principal's secret key.
- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`: the name of the storage account that this backup will be sent to.
- `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY`: the secret key associated with the storage account.
- `CONTAINER_NAME`: the name of the container to store this backup in.

You can initiate this plan from the command line in the same way as the Amazon S3 backup plan:
```
dcos cassandra plan start backup-azure -p SNAPSHOT_NAME=$SNAPSHOT_NAME -p "CASSANDRA_KEYSPACES=$CASSANDRA_KEYSPACES" -p CLIENT_ID=$CLIENT_ID -p TENANT_ID=$TENANT_ID -p CLIENT_SECRET=$CLIENT_SECRET -p AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=$AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT -p AZURE_STORAGE_KEY=$AZURE_STORAGE_KEY -p CONTAINER_NAME=$CONTAINER_NAME
```

<a name="restore"></a>
## Restore

All restore plans will restore the schema from every keyspace backed up with the backup plan and populate those keyspaces with the data they contained at the time the snapshot was taken. Downloading and restoration of backups will use the configured backup/restore strategy. This plan assumes that the keyspaces being restored do not already exist in the current cluster, and will fail if any keyspace with the same name is present.

### Restoring From S3

Restoring cluster data is similar to backing it up. The `restore-s3` plan assumes that your data is stored in an S3 bucket in the format that `backup-s3` uses. The restore plan has the following parameters:
- `SNAPSHOT_NAME`: the snapshot name from the `backup-s3` plan.
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: the access key ID for the AWS IAM user running this restore.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: the secret access key for the AWS IAM user running this restore.
- `AWS_REGION`: the region of the S3 bucket being used to store the backup being restored.
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: the name of the S3 bucket where the backup is stored.

To initiate this plan from the command line:
```
SNAPSHOT_NAME=<my_snapshot>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<my_access_key_id>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<my_secret_access_key>
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
S3_BUCKET_NAME=backups
dcos beta-cassandra plan start backup-s3 "SNAPSHOT_NAME=$SNAPSHOT_NAME,AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,AWS_REGION=$AWS_REGION,S3_BUCKET_NAME=$S3_BUCKET_NAME"
```

### Restoring From Azure

You can restore from Microsoft Azure using the `restore-azure` plan. This plan requires the following parameters to run:

- `SNAPSHOT_NAME`: the name of this snapshot. Snapshots for individual nodes will be stored as gzipped tarballs with the name `node-<POD_INDEX>.tar.gz`.
- `CLIENT_ID`: the client ID for the Azure service principal running this backup.
- `TENANT_ID`: the tenant ID for the tenant that the service principal belongs to.
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: the service principal's secret key.
- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`: the name of the storage account that this backup will be sent to.
- `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY`: the secret key associated with the storage account.
- `CONTAINER_NAME`: the name of the container to store this backup in.

You can initiate this plan from the command line in the same way as the Amazon S3 restore plan:
```
dcos cassandra plan start restore-azure -p SNAPSHOT_NAME=$SNAPSHOT_NAME -p CLIENT_ID=$CLIENT_ID -p TENANT_ID=$TENANT_ID -p CLIENT_SECRET=$CLIENT_SECRET -p AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=$AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT -p AZURE_STORAGE_KEY=$AZURE_STORAGE_KEY -p CONTAINER_NAME=$CONTAINER_NAME
```

# Troubleshooting

<a name="accessing-logs"></a>
## Accessing Logs

Logs for the scheduler and all service nodes can be viewed from the DC/OS web interface.

- Scheduler logs are useful for determining why a node isn't being launched (this is under the purview of the Scheduler).
- Node logs are useful for examining problems in the service itself.

In all cases, logs are generally piped to files named `stdout` and/or `stderr`.

To view logs for a given node, perform the following steps:
1. Visit <dcos-url> to access the DC/OS web interface.
1. Navigate to `Services` and click on the service to be examined (default `cassandra`).
1. In the list of tasks for the service, click on the task to be examined (scheduler is named after the service, nodes are each `node-<NUM>-server`).
1. In the task details, click on the `Logs` tab to go into the log viewer. By default, you will see `stdout`, but `stderr` is also useful. Use the pull-down in the upper right to select the file to be examined.

You can also access the logs via the Mesos UI:
1. Visit <dcos-url>/mesos to view the Mesos UI.
1. Click the `Frameworks` tab in the upper left to get a list of services running in the cluster.
1. Navigate into the correct framework for your needs. The scheduler runs under `marathon` with a task name matching the service name (default _`PKGNAME`_). Service nodes run under a framework whose name matches the service name (default _`PKGNAME`_).
1. You should now see two lists of tasks. `Active Tasks` are tasks currently running, and `Completed Tasks` are tasks that have exited. Click the `Sandbox` link for the task you wish to examine.
1. The `Sandbox` view will list files named `stdout` and `stderr`. Click the file names to view the files in the browser, or click `Download` to download them to your system for local examination. Note that very old tasks will have their Sandbox automatically deleted to limit disk space usage.

<a name="limitations"></a>
# Limitations

- For multi-data-center configurations, the hostnames for the seed nodes in each cluster must be routable from every other cluster. Typically, DC/OS hosts are members of a private subnet that is not routable from external hosts, so further network configuration is required to achieve this.
