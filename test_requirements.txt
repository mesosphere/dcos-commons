# Deprecated libraries which are still used by sdk-0.40 and external repos.
# dcos-commons master meanwhile doesn't use these anymore as of PR#2616, but we still include them
# here for now. Remove these once sdk-0.40 and external repos have upgraded their testing/.
# - required for dcos.servicemanager library, used internally in the dcos library:
git+https://github.com/dcos/dcos-cli.git@f1fd38c9e72e1d521cf8120fe4948a789fb40cbc#egg=dcoscli&subdirectory=cli
# - manually select the correct version of the dcos library to avoid a package_manager param count issue in the version declared by shakedown:
git+https://github.com/dcos/dcos-cli.git@f1fd38c9e72e1d521cf8120fe4948a789fb40cbc
# - refrain from jumping to 1.5 since we're moving off shakedown anyway:
dcos-shakedown==1.4.12

# Used by tools/create_testing_volumes.py (and for dcos-launch CLI):
