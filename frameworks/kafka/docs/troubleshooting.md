The Kafka service will be listed as "Unhealthy" when it detects any underreplicated partitions. This error condition usually indicates a malfunctioning broker. Use the `dcos kafka topic under_replicated_partitions` and `dcos kafka topic describe <topic-name>` commands to find the problem broker and determine what actions are required.

Possible repair actions include `dcos kafka broker restart <broker-id>` and `dcos kafka broker replace <broker-id>`. The replace operation is destructive and will irrevocably lose all data associated with the broker. The restart operation is not destructive and indicates an attempt to restart a broker process.

# Replacing a Permanently Failed Server

If a machine has permanently failed, manual intervention is required to replace the broker or brokers that resided on that machine. Because DC/OS Kafka uses persistent volumes, the service continuously attempts to replace brokers where their data has been persisted. In the case where a machine has permanently failed, use the Kafka CLI to replace the brokers.

In the example below, the broker with id `0` will be replaced on new machine as long as cluster resources are sufficient to satisfy the serviceâ€™s placement constraints and resource requirements.

    $ dcos kafka broker replace 0
