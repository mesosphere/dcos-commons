## Version 2.1.1-3.0.15-beta

## NOTICE

This is a beta release of the DC/OS Apache Cassandra framework. It contains multiple improvements as well as new features that are to be considered of beta quality. Do _not_ operate this version in production.

### Updates
- The Cassandra tasks no longer run inside a docker container. This removes the requirement that on Centos based distributions the service must be run as root.

### Bug Fixes
- Scheduler health check now passes during service uninstall.
- Fixed a regression in replacing failed pods on failed agents.
- Replacing a pod on a failed agent now no longer waits for Mesos to register the agent as lost.
