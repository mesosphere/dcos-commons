/**

 * NOTE: Does not protect against multithreaded access. All calls should only be made on a single thread, separate from
 * the thread that receives offers. Otherwise there is a risk of a deadlock because SchedulerDriver.reviveOffers() can
 * block on sending us new offers.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Suppress is performed whenever the underlying services are all idle and no further offers are needed. This allows
 * Mesos to scale to more frameworks. When the framework is suppressed, it will not receive any offers for any reason.
 * </li>
 * <li>From our perspective, a Revive call will reset any prior Suppress call, and/or reset any offers which were
 * previously declined, resulting in all offers being sent again. It should be invoked when any new work has appeared,
 * but Revive calls should be rate limited to avoid taxing Mesos.</li>
